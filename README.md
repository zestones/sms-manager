# sms_manager

This is a simple SMS manager that allows you to send SMS messages to a list of phone numbers. The list of phone numbers should be stored in a csv file. The SMS manager reads the csv file and sends the SMS messages to the phone numbers in the list.

## Example of a CSV file

```csv
FirstName,LastName,Phone Number,Categories
John Doe,1234567890,[Family, Friends]
Jane Doe,0987654321,[Family]
```

## Debugging

In android studio, you can find the app files inside the folder: `/data/app/data/com.example.sms_manage`
